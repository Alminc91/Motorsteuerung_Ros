To compile, execute the following steps in the folder
where you have cloned the project repository.

1. Edit '/opt/ros/groovy/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake':
   Insert the line 'include(workspace.cmake OPTIONAL)' right
   after 'cmake_minimum_required'.

2. $ source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash

3. $ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<DEBUG|RELEASE>

   In case of failure add the flag '-k' to the catkin_make command.
   Then execute this command a few times until everything has been built successfully.
